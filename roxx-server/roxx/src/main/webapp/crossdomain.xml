    This file is needed for flash to make it possible to load data
    from different domains as the one that provides the .swf file.
    
    If one runs a built .swf file just via a double click that
    behaviour is the same as if the .swf and the backend are on
    different domains. So in a real world scenario or with a complete
    build-process that file would not be needed.
